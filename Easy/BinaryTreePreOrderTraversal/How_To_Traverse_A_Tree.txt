There are two general strategies to traverse a tree:
    - Breadth First Search (BFS):
        We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height, from top to bottom.
        The nodes on higher levels would be visited before the ones with lower levels.

    - Depth First Search (DFS):
        In this strategy, we adopt the depth as the priority, so that one would start from a root and reach 
        all the way down to a certain leaf, and then back to the root to reach another branch.

        The DFS strategy can further be distinguish as preorder, inorder, and postorder depending on the 
        relative order among the root node, left node, and right node.
